# Human Activity Recognition Using Time Series Data

## Introduction

This project explores the classification of human activities using time series data collected from a Wireless Sensor Network. The AReM dataset comprises seven different types of activities, each represented in its folder containing multiple files. Each file captures six time series corresponding to a particular activity instance, with features named as avg rss12, var rss12, avg rss13, var rss13, vg rss23, and ar rss23.

## Dataset Description

The AReM dataset contains 88 instances, each with 480 consecutive values across six time series. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+system+based+on+Multisensor+data+fusion+%28AReM%29).

## Methodology

### Data Partitioning

Datasets 1 and 2 in the 'bending1' and 'bending2' folders, along with datasets 1, 2, and 3 in the other folders, are designated as test data. The remaining datasets are used for training.

### Feature Extraction

Time-domain features are extracted for use in classification, including:
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Mean
- Median
- Standard deviation
- First quartile
- Third quartile

These features can be normalized or used directly, as per the model's requirement.

### Feature Selection

Based on exploratory analysis and domain knowledge, three key time-domain features are chosen for their potential significance in classifying activities.

## Binary Classification Using Logistic Regression

Scatter plots are created for selected features from the training data, highlighting the distinction between 'bending' activities and others. Further experiments include breaking down each time series into two equal lengths and extracting features from these subdivisions to observe any differences in classification outcomes.

### Logistic Regression with Cross-Validation

Logistic regression models are trained with varying lengths of time series subdivisions (l âˆˆ {1, 2, ..., 20}), and 5-fold cross-validation is used to select the best combination of time series length and the number of features. Stratified cross-validation is employed if necessary to handle class imbalance.

## Results

### Model Performance

The confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC are provided for the best logistic regression model on the training data. Parameters and associated p-values for the model are reported.

### Testing on Unseen Data

The chosen classifier is then tested on the test dataset, which is processed similarly to the training set. Comparison of test accuracy with cross-validation accuracy from the training phase is discussed.

### Stability and Class Imbalance

Questions of model stability due to well-separated classes and potential class imbalance are addressed. If imbalance is detected, logistic regression based on case-control sampling is performed, and its results are analyzed.

## Penalized Logistic Regression

The process is repeated using L1-penalized logistic regression, cross-validating over the number of subdivisions and the penalty weight. A comparison is made between this method and variable selection using p-values.

## Multiclass Classification

An L1-penalized multinomial regression model is built for classifying
